            <h2 class="my-3">Dictation Mode</h2>
            <p>Netflix is a good language learning tool. We can learn English by watching movies, and the Dictation mode can help you learn more efficiently!</p>
            <img class="img-fluid my-3" src="image/intro/1.jpg">
            <p>We convert the subtitles into a format that you can input. The film will automatically pause before the subtitles end, and you can press the spacebar to listen to the dialogue again and input it. This allows us to simultaneously train various English skills. Most importantly, dictation is interactive, and it can enhance learning and memory retention.</p>
            <img class="img-fluid my-3" src="image/intro/2.jpg">
            <p>To make it more challenging, you can use the ] or \ key to hide the main or secondary subtitles.</p>
            <img class="img-fluid my-3" src="image/intro/4.jpg">
            <p>Dictation mode allows you to use most of the features available in regular mode. For example, you can set the secondary subtitles to your native language as assistance.</p>
            <h2 class="my-3">Q&A</h2>
            <p class="fw-bold mb-2">1. Subtitles and dialogue don't match?</p>
            <p class="mb-2">Unfortunately, not every video is suitable for dictation mode. Please choose videos that provide "English [CC]" subtitles.</p>
            <p class="fw-bold mb-2">2. The video pauses before the dialogue ends?</p>
            <p class="mb-2">Since each subtitle has a different end time, it depends on the considerations of the subtitle creators. Our solution is that you can adjust the subtitle delay compensation time in the settings to extend the subtitle end time.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">Additionally, we have built a simple subtitle editor, which allows you to fix these subtitles yourself. (Disable image subtitles and open the subtitle editor through the player menu)</p>
            <p class="fw-bold mb-2">3. How can I turn off the typing sound?</p>
            <p class="mb-2">Please go to the plugin settings page or click
              <a href="/options.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold mb-2">4. Does dictation mode support other languages?</p>
            <p class="mb-2">Currently, it only supports English.</p>
            <p class="fw-bold mb-2">5. Feeling overwhelmed?</p>
            <p class="mb-2">We recommend that beginners start by learning the first 5000 words sorted by frequency of use, and then gradually increase the difficulty. You can adjust this option in the settings. (The word list we use is sourced from hackerb9, for more details please refer to: <a href="https://github.com/hackerb9/gwordlist" target="_blank">https://github.com/hackerb9/gwordlist</a>)</p>

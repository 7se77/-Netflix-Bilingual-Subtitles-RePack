            <p>Netflix offers many films for us to learn from, but there are even more on YouTube!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, not every video on YouTube has subtitles provided by the creators. To learn from these videos, we can make use of the subtitles offered by YouTube, namely the CC subtitles. As you may already know, YouTube automatically adds subtitles to uploaded videos (mainly in English), we can utilize these subtitles to learn English.</p>

            <p>However, we will quickly discover that due to the fact that these subtitles are machine-generated, sentences are often connected together or separated into different paragraphs.</p>
            <img class="img-fluid my-3" src="image/youtube/2.jpg">
            <p>To solve this problem, we provide a drag-and-drop subtitle feature where you can freely place the CC subtitles into different paragraphs. This way, we can learn through these subtitles.</p>

            <p>When you click the play button, the plugin will play the corresponding subtitle, and after it finishes playing, it will automatically pause the video. Additionally, CC subtitles have a great feature that provides an accurate timeline, allowing us to replay the pronunciation of a particular word by simply clicking on the word in the subtitle.</p>

            <p class="fw-bold mb-2">3. There are many errors in the subtitles?</p>
